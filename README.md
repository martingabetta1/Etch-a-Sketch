# Etch-a-Sketch
 My submission of the Etch-a-Sketch project for TOP.
## Scope of the project

- This project wont use hover for drawing, instead, we'll use active (clicked) elements.
- Resizable grid
- Clear screen button
- Color picker button
- Eraser option (set the element to default)
- Rainbow option (makes a trail of random colors)
- Gradient option (adds a color with 10% opacity, stackable)
